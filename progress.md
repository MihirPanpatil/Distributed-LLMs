# Project Progress Log

## Initial Setup (2023-11-15)
- Created project structure with src/ directory
  - src/master/node.py: Basic master node implementation
  - src/worker/node.py: Worker node skeleton
  - src/model/: Model-related functionality
- Implemented model loading functionality in src/model/loader.py
  - Uses AutoModel.from_pretrained() with device_map='auto'
  - Automatic dtype selection based on GPU capability (fp16/fp32)
  - Added error handling for invalid model paths

## Model Components (2023-11-16)
- Basic model loading with AutoModel and AutoTokenizer
  - Supports HuggingFace model hub and local paths
  - Added model verification checks
- Automatic device mapping and dtype selection
  - GPU detection and capability assessment
  - Fallback to CPU if CUDA unavailable
- Model downloader implementation (src/model/downloader.py)
  - Resumable downloads with progress tracking
  - Checksum verification for downloaded files

## Current Work (2023-11-17)
### Model Sharding (Completed)
- Implemented shard_manager.py for model partitioning
  - Layer-wise sharding strategy with parameter grouping
  - Metadata tracking in shard_info.json
  - Automatic shard directory creation
  - Model reconstruction functionality
  - Comprehensive test coverage in test_shard_manager.py

### Network Protocol (Completed)
- Implemented MessageProtocol in protocol.py
  - Supports message sending with:
    - Commands
    - Payloads
    - Metadata
  - Message receiving with:
    - Header parsing
    - Payload handling
    - Error cases (timeout, invalid header, connection closed)
  - Comprehensive test coverage in test_protocol.py

### Worker Implementation (Completed 2023-11-18)
- Implemented all core functionality:
  - Shard loading/unloading with device management
  - Computation scheduling with priority handling
  - Result aggregation and network communication
- Features:
  - Heartbeat monitoring
  - Automatic device detection (CUDA/CPU)
  - Threaded connection handling
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Full test coverage in test_node.py

## Testing Progress
- [x] Model loading tests (test_loader.py)
- [x] Shard manager tests (test_shard_manager.py)
- [x] Network protocol tests (test_protocol.py)
- [x] Worker integration tests (test_node.py)

## Challenges
- CUDA memory fragmentation with large models
- Need better error recovery for network partitions
- Shard transfer overhead needs optimization
- Optimizing test execution time for CI/CD pipeline
